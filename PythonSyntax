You can interact with Python in Two Ways
    
     1.Command Line
     2.Save file with extension .py

Python Indentation

     Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line
     
     Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important
     
     Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code

     Example:

            if 5 > 2:
             print("Five is greater than two!")

       From our Example

          We see from print,it start after word i this mean that if statement interact with print function

      This is what we call Identation

      To handle this identation easily from myself, I use Sublime Text


Python Variable
    
    What is varibale?

        Variables are containers for storing data values

    
     Python has no command for declaring a variable

     A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it

     You simply say
            
            #Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type

               x=5
               Y="Hello, World"
               X='Hello, World'
            
            #Specify data type of variable

               x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
               y = int(3)    # y will be 3
               z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0 
            
            #You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function

               x = 5
               y = "John"
               print(type(x))
               print(type(y))

            #String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes

               Y="blackninja23"
               #Single or double quote for String, It is same things
               X='blackninja23'

            #Variable names are case-sensitive
                
                a=5
                A="Hello"
                #a and A variable are different variable

Python Comments

    Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

    Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
        
        Example

            Comments in Python:
                #This is a comment.
                print("Hello, World!")
